     <h1>   Why Justin Herbert was the Clear Offensive Rookie of the Year </h1>
     <hr>
     
     
     <body>
  <p> Justin Herbert was drafted in the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft at pick number 6 by the Los Angeles Chargers. Herbert surpised many, as he broke countless rookie quarterback records. Some argue that Justin Herbert is the greatest rookie quarterback ever. Many didn't have high expectations for Herbert, yet he proved them wrong by winning the NFL's Offensive Rookie of the Year(OROY) award. However, there is a considerable amount of fans that believe the trophy should've been awarded to Minnesota Viking's rookie wide reciever, Justin Jefferson, which is COMPLETELY WRONG. </p>

   <h4> Why Justin Herbert rightfully deserved OROY</h4>
   <ul>
     <li> Herbert broke more records than Jefferson while playing one less game than him</li>
     <li> The quarterback position is harder than the wide reciever position </li>
     <li> Herbert was more vital to his team's success than Jefferson was for his (It's far more easier to replace a wr than a qb)</li>
     <li> Herbert had arguably the greatest rookie QB season ever </li>
     <li> Herbert broke all these records while having the worst ranked offensive line (per Pro Football Focus)</li>
     <li> Herbert was coached under Anthony Lynn, who was so inadequate at his job, that he was fired immediately after the season ended </li>
     <li> Jefferson had less pressure on him because Adam Thielen (who some would argue is a top 10 wr) was higher on the depth chart than him </li>
     <li> Jefferson didn't even have the biggest impact on his own team (His Vikings teammate - Dalvin Cook, a top 5 runningback, had a greater impact)
   </ul>
   <br>
   <h5> Why Others Believe Justin Jefferson deserved OROY </h5>
   <ul>
     <li class="jeff"> Offensive Rookie of the Year is a QB biased award </li>
     <li class="jeff"> Jefferson made the Pro Bowl whereas Hebert didn't </li>
     <li class="jeff"> Jefferson made 2nd Team All Pro whereas Herbert didn't make any All Pro teams </li>
     <li class="jeff"> The Vikings were 27th in passing attempts and Jefferson still broke the rookie recieving record </li>
     <li class="jeff"> Jefferson had arguably the greatest rookie WR season </li>
     <li class="jeff"> Jefferson broke Randy Moss' rookie reception franchise record </li>
     <li class="jeff"> Jefferson wasn't not as heavily involved in the Viking's offensive game plan in weeks 1 through 2 </li>
    </ul>

    <h6>So What Now? </h6>
  <p>   As you can see, Justin Hebert managed to break far more records than Justin Jefferson did. If you took Justin Herbert and Justin Jefferson off of their respective teams, the Los Angeles Chargers would be worse off than the Minnesota Vikings because Hebert has a greater impact on his team. Also, before winning the Offensive Rookie of the Year award, Herbert won the NFL's Pepsi Rookie of the Year award which is decided by fan voting. It is without a doubt that these two young men played historic seasons, however, Hebert's performance was just simply better.</p>
